My name is Wang Junqiao, and I come from Hangzhou, Zhejiang.
I am now a second year postgraduate student, and I study in computer science department, Zhejiang University.
During my undergraduate time, I focused on the college programming contest and participated in many of this kind of competition and also won many prizes, even the champion of zhejiang province. This experience is what I feel most proud for myself. 
After graduate, I joint the Database Lab. of Zhejiang University and helped build some projects, like a Music Recommend App 'Bian zou bian ting'. In March 2014, I was dispatched to Netease to develop a website for VLDB 2014, which is the first time I'm working outside of campus and I'm feeling so good.
In my spare time, I like playing PC games and playing basketball.
That's all, Thank you.
